## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```scss
@media screen and (min-width: 1000px)
```

I learned that with sass I need to use "and" in order to use the brackets when using a media query in sass. Additionally, I learned that .sass files are different to .scss files in that .sass files do not have curly brackets, semicolons and use indentation.

### Useful resources

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - This was my first time using a .sass stylesheet so the guide on this page helped me to figure out why my sass code was failing to compile when I used semicolons!
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand mobile first web design.
I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
