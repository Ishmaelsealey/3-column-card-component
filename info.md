# What I will use

A class for each button and each icon at the top of the section.
An h1 tag enclosing sedans.
Use a `<main>` tag to enclose all three sections and use `<section>` for each section.
Each section would have the same basic layout, with identical padding and position of each element.

Style the buttons with a border on each so when they are hovered over, the button will not change size because a border is added.

Mobile first design with the desktop version appearing at 1110px.
`box sizing: border box`

I estimate time to completion will be 2 hours 30 mins of coding, 1 hour of prior research.
An additional 15-30 mins for dealing with svgs as I'm not familiar with them.
I took 2 hours, 5 minutes of straight coding to complete the entire project. The SVGs took no additional time.
